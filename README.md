#  Healthcare Patient Survey Data Analysis (Learning Project)

This is a beginner-friendly data analysis project using hospital patient satisfaction data (HCAHPS) to learn the basics of data cleaning, visualization, and insight generation.

##  What I Learned

- How to load and process real-world data using Python (pandas)
- Cleaning techniques like handling missing values and converting data types
- Visualizing distributions using histograms and boxplots (matplotlib/seaborn)
- Understanding survey-based healthcare data from a patient perspective

##  Dataset

Due to file size limits, only a sample of 100 rows is included in this repo: `sample_hcahps_data.csv`

> **Full Dataset Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggleprollc/healthcare-patient-satisfaction-data-collection?resource=download

##  Tools Used

- Python  
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook (for exploratory work)

##  Files

- `EDA_PatientSatisfaction.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook  
- `sample_hcahps_data.csv`: Sample dataset for testing  
- `requirements.txt`: Python libraries required

##  Future Improvements

- Deeper insights by grouping data by state, ownership, and year  
- Add SQL queries to support backend analysis  
- Explore more advanced visualizations (heatmaps, trendlines)
